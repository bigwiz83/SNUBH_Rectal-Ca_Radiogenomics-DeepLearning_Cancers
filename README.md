# SNUBH_Rectal-Ca_Radiogenomics-DeepLearning_Cancers

This repository contains the matlab code used in 'Radiogenomic and deep learning network approaches to predict KRAS mutation and microsatellite instability status from radiotherapy plan' article.

This study aimed to seek the feasibility of radiogenomics and deep learning method for prediction of KRAS mutation status and microsatellite instability in patients with locally advanced cancer. To do this, we used the clinical target volume for boost in patients who received concurrent chemoradiation. Thus, if you'd like to use source code within this repository, DICOM image files of radiation therapy planning CT and DICOM RS structure files are required. In general, DICOM image and structure files can be easily exported from your treatment planning system (TPS). We downloaded these from Varian and Pinnacle TPS system. Also, for reproductivity, you should be able to use 'CERR' matlab package: https://github.com/cerr/CERR 

Though we validated internally in single institution, we hope this method can be expanded and validated in your research.
